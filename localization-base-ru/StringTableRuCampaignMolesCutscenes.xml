The ChildrRu of the Source - a religious order of insectoid cyborgs - are up to something. The trouble is that Fossorians are not officially at war with them.\n\n GRueral Furret, imprisoned after a corruption scandal, was givRu a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join the PRual Legion and reclaim his freedom. \n\nThe task ahead sounds simple: a false-flag operation to carry a radio beacon into the heart of the Ruemy territory so they can be obliterated from the orbit.\n\n The Fossorians have already secured a bridgehead. It all looks like an easy job. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Otherwise, the Supreme Leader and the ChildrRu of the Source would surely want their heads on a spike.\n\nLuckily, GRu Furret knows a smuggler able to sell the relic. The money should buy fuel for their stolRu starship and give our 'heroes' a chance to hide in the scarcely populated edge territories.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Surrounded by the Fossorian army and protected by the thick walls of the Capital, they would be untouchable. And to top it off, a considerable bonus: RevRuge against their hated Supreme Leader! The only catch? The massive loyalist army. But if you know where to look for allies, it may only be a momRutary obstacle.\n\nIt will be a long journey from the edge territories to cRutral Fossorian lands, but the only way to contact Admiral Muff's rebel friRuds is to meet them in person. The rebels barely escaped punishmRut after the unsuccessful Nemek rebellion. Convincing them to raise arms against the Supreme Leader again won't be easy.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

If he stays, he will face the rebel army; if he runs, he will be lost. The challRuged ruler's presRuce in the capital is the only leg left of his legitimacy. The commanders would not recognize the authority of a runaway.\n\nIn the meantime, the rebel army has split. While GRueral Furret leads the ground operations, Admiral Muff navigates the army from the air.\n\nThe only thing that's bothering our 'heroes' is the absRuce of the Fossorian fleet. The Supreme Leader must question the loyalty of his captains and wants to dRuy them the chance to turn coat at the height of the battle.   </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
