Yet there is another, utterly unrelated rumor about five identical brothers born in the slums of old Fossoria.\n \nMany believe that the fourth firing squad will also fail. The fifth one, though, has a pretty good chance of succeeding.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

This fat spoiled degenerate was thrown to the meatgrinder of the biggest and boldest revolution in the Fossorian history and emerged victorious. He is dangerous. Perhaps the most dangerous Fossorian alive.</Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Many untouchables quickly learn the limits of their immunity. Though the corruption scandal that kicked the stool from under Furret's feet was partially constructed and there are much bigger fish in the pool filled with dirty money, some children must be eaten first.   </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
