But one man once said: Every plan goes to hell after the first shot is fired. Accept the entropy, and embrace the ever-changing chaos of the battle. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

If you pass it, the vortex field will not react, but each soldier is counted and only when the unit is deep in the minefield, the mines will start to explode. Not all the Sovereign Fleet warriors are paragons of virtue. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

There is no need for tests, when life in the Sovereign Fleet is one big exam. Many frozen corpses are floating in space. Each one is a student who failed a test. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>

Every inhabitant survives thanks to the technology they take care of. One can't exist without the other. When you observe a 5-year-old child from a space station, you quickly realize that it is more skillful than an MIT graduate after 4 years of studies. </Text>  </GameDBLocalizedString>
